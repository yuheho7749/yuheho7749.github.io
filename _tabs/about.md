I'm Joseph, a Master's student in Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara researching AI applications in computer security. As part of the [SecLab](https://seclab.cs.ucsb.edu/) at UCSB, my work focuses on the intersection between AI and traditional computer security disciplines, such as using AI for binary and malware analysis. I'm also collaborating with the finalist team [Shellphish](https://shellphish.net/) on the [AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC)](https://aicyberchallenge.com/). 

Outside of my research, I'm passionate about high performance and secure systems design, Linux development, and contributing to open-source projects. 

In my free time, I enjoy speedcubing -- solving the Rubik's Cube and other twisty puzzles as quickly as possible -- and occassionally compete in local competitions. I also enjoy developing and playing video games, along with adjusting hardware configurations to optimize performance.
